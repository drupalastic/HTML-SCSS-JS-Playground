# An HTML SCSS and JAVASCIPT Playground for developers.

recommended node version : 12.3.1

setup :
clone the repository
run `npm install`

once install completes
run `gulp watch`

index.html and script.js is used as it is. 
JS files are not processed because most browsers supports latest JS features. In case you are an IE-11 user - you may consider using https://github.com/drupalastic/HTML-SCSS-JS-Starterkit 

style.scss will be compiled to style.css. Browser will refresh automatically on change.
